# PixelFox

A pixel-based game written from scratch in C++20 and DirectX 11  
(but CPU-side renderer: meaning I can't really use DirectX 11 to render, 

works like:   
only render onto a texture on the CPU, then upload that texture to the GPU and display it on a fullscreen quad).  
No engines, no frameworks: every system is built manually from scratch.
