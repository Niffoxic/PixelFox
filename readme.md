# PixelFox

A pixel-based game written completely from scratch in C++20 and DirectX 11.  
No external engine, no framework — everything built step by step.

## Structure
- **PixelFoxEngine** — handles rendering, input, and timing  
- **PixelFoxPhysics** — provides simple 2D physics and collision handling  
- **PixelFoxGame** — main gameplay layer using both modules

## Build
Requires Visual Studio 2022 (C++20) and Windows 10/11.  
Open `PixelFox.sln` and build (x64, Debug or Release).

## Goal
To create a fully functional 2D pixel engine and game framework from scratch;
